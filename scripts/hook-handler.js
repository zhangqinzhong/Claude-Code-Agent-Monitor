/**
 * Claude Code hook handler.
 * Receives hook event JSON on stdin and forwards it to every live Agent
 * Dashboard server. Designed to fail silently so it never blocks Claude
 * Code, and to fan out across multiple dashboards (e.g. the macOS desktop
 * app running alongside `npm run dev`) so each one keeps its real-time
 * stream.
 *
 * Delivery is fire-and-forget: we exit as soon as the request body is on the
 * wire, WITHOUT waiting for the dashboard's HTTP response. The hook only needs
 * to *deliver* the event — on loopback the local server reads the buffered
 * request and processes it even after this short-lived process exits. Waiting
 * for the response is what made Claude Code sit at "running hooks" for seconds
 * whenever a dashboard was busy, slow, or wedged.
