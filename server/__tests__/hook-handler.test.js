/**
 * @file Regression tests for scripts/hook-handler.js delivery behavior. The
 * handler must never block Claude Code waiting for the dashboard's HTTP
 * response — it delivers the event (flushes the request) and exits, leaving the
 * local server to process the buffered request on its own schedule. These tests
 * lock in that non-blocking contract so a future refactor can't reintroduce the
 * "stuck running hooks" stall (handler waiting up to the per-request timeout for
 * a slow/busy/wedged dashboard to reply).
